# Universal Interfacer

Universal Interfacer is a simple shell script that creates a universal list graphical user interface (GUI) in `Zenity` to list all `.sh` files from the `panels` folder. 
It allows users to select an item from the list, and then runs the corresponding `bash file.sh` command.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository to your local machine using `git clone`:

```git clone https://github.com/Shmelc-sh/Universal-Interfacer.git```


2. Navigate to the cloned directory:

3. Make the script executable:

```chmod +x UI.sh```


## Usage
